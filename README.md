An earlier version of this project (Experiment 2D and early modeling results) was released as:

Wu, C.M., Schulz, E., Speekenbrink, M., Nelson, J.D., Meder, B. (2017). Mapping the unknown: The spatially correlated multi-armed bandit. In G. Gunzelmann, A. Howes, T. Tenbrink, & E. J. Davelaar (Eds.), Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1357-1362). Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/106286


## Getting Started and prerequisites

The experimental environments were generated using `samplePrior1D.py` and `samplePrior2D.py`, which requires numpy, GPy, and Scikit-learn

The rest of the data analysis uses R, with code separated into \analysis1D and \analysis2D. Required packages are specified at the top of each file.
