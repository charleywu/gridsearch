                    <h4> Aim of the study and content </h4>
                    <p> This study is a research project of the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Human Development in cooperation with Harvard University. The data collected will be used for research purposes only. 
                    The purpose of this study is to investigate how people search in an unknown environment. For this purpose you will be asked to perform a simple computer task in which you learn about areas on a grid and uncover rewards. A <b>bonus of up to $1.50</b> will be granted based on your performance, along with a <b>basic fee of $0.50</b> for completing the study. There will be no payment if the study is not completed. The study will on average last about <b>15 minutes</b>. </p>

                    <h4> What will happen to the data collected </h4>
                    <p>After completing the experiment your Mturk ID will be deleted from the study data, once we have awarded you your bonus payment. This means that it will become impossible to link the study data to you. </p>


                    <p>The study data (but not Mturk ID) may be shared with cooperation partners for collaborative analysis. The study data may also be made publicly accessible via research data bases or scientific publications (typically via the Internet). This makes it possible for other researchers to check or replicate the results and enhances the quality of scientific research. The study data may also be used for new research questions going beyond the purposes of this particular study. </p>

                    <p>Participation in this study is voluntary. You may withdraw from the study at any time.  You may also withdraw your consent to data processing and usage at any time before payment with effect for the future. To do so, please contact Charley Wu, <font color="blue">cwu[at]mpib-berlin[dot]mpg[dot]de</font>. Please note that data collected from you can no longer be associated with you, once your Mturk ID is deleted from the study data after payment. </p>

                        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                        <p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully: </b></p>
                        <br>
                        <p> In the following study, you will be presented with a series of <b>8 different grids to explore</b>. By clicking on tiles in the grid, you reveal points that are associated to the location on the grid. On each grid, you will have <b>either 20 or 40 clicks</b>, with the number of remaining clicks displayed above the grid. When you run out of clicks, you will start a new trial on the next unexplored grid.<p>
                        <p> Each grid starts with a single tile revealed. Use your mouse to click and reveal new tiles, which will display a number corresponding to the number of points you gain. Revealed tiles are also color coded, as a visual aid to help you in this task. Darker colors correspond to larger rewards. Previously revealed tiles can also be reselected and there may be small changes in the point value.</p>
                        <p> It is your task to <b>gain as many points as possible</b> across all 8 grids. You will be assigned a bonus of up to $1.50 based on your total score across all grids. </p>
                        <p><b>Important!</b> Points are clustered along the grid, such that areas with high-value points tend to appear close to each other and areas of low-value points tend to appear close to each other. All payoffs are greater than zero, with the maximum payoff differing between grids. </p>
                        <p>Below, we show some examples of what the distribution of points are like, with the darker tiles indicating higher point values.</p>
